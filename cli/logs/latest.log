[19:45:43] [Client thread/INFO]: [STDERR]: [LWJGL] [ERROR] Incompatible Java and native library versions detected.
Possible reasons:

	b) The classpath contains jar files of an older LWJGL version.
Possible solutions:
	a) Make sure to not set -Djava.library.path (it is not needed for developing with LWJGL 3) or make
	   sure the folder it points to contains the shared libraries of the correct LWJGL version.
	b) Check the classpath and make sure to only have jar files of the same LWJGL version in it.
